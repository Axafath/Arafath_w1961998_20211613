# ðŸŽ“ Student Stress Prediction and Clustering

This project aims to analyze and predict stress levels among IIT undergraduate students using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. By clustering students based on stress-related features and building predictive models, the project uncovers hidden patterns in stress experiences and identifies at-risk student groups. These insights can help educational institutions implement targeted mental health support and intervention strategies.

The data was collected through a structured survey covering academic, financial, personal, social, environmental, and coping-related stressors. The project includes clustering analysis, predictive modeling, and a dashboard to visualize key findings.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Clustering students using K-Means to identify stress pattern groups (e.g., low, moderate, high stress).
- Predicting individual student stress levels using classification models.
- Visualizations (radar plots, bar charts) to explain cluster characteristics.
- Analysis based on multiple stress dimensions: academic, financial, social, personal, environmental, and coping strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Files
- `code/` â€“ Python scripts for data preprocessing, clustering, and model training.
- `report/` â€“ Final report including methodology, analysis, findings, and discussion.
- `dashboard/` â€“ Visual outputs used for interpreting clusters and stress distributions.
- `dataset/` â€“ Cleaned and anonymized survey data used in the project.
